Abstract 	The Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) presents global and regional forest data by global ecological zone (GEZ). The GEZ spatial dataset used by FAO has developed over the years from covering only the tropical areas (1990) to the globe (2000). Due to the developments in remote sensing and the compiling of many spatial products relating to climate and land cover between 2000 and 2010, an update to the map was commissioned and resulted in the available GEZ 2010 product
Purpose 	Main uses of the map include: a) reporting purposes, to provide baseline forest statistics by ecological zone; b) analysis and modelling purposes, i.e. assessment of forest-based biological diversity, both at ecosystem and species level, and biomass modelling.

Language 	English
Character set 	UTF8: 8-bit variable size UCS Transfer Format, based on ISO/IEC 10646
Coordinate System	EPSG: 4326
