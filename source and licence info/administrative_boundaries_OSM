# Description
Within FLINT, Administrative Boundaries are used as a ‘location’ input in the modelling system and help to control where the simulation is conducted. This includes determining the appropriate emission factors to be applied (based on the relevant continent). By incorporating subnational boundaries, it is possible to separate the results by counties or sub-national administrative regions (eg Provinces, regions, districts, states, etc).
